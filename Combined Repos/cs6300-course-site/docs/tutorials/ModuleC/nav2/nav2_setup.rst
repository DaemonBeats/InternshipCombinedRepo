Nav2 Setup
===========

Once a localization or SLAM node is providing the robot's pose, you can add the **Nav2 navigation stack** to enable point‑and‑click autonomous navigation using the 2D Goal Pose tool in RViz2.

How It Works
------------

The 2D Goal Pose button in RViz2 publishes a ``geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`` message to the ``/goal_pose`` topic. Nav2's **BT Navigator** subscribes to this topic, plans a path using the **Planner Server**, and drives the car to the goal using the **Controller Server**.

   * - Nav2 Component
     - Role
   * - ``amcl``
     - Localizes the car on the map (Monte Carlo localization)
   * - ``planner_server``
     - Global path planning (A* / NavFn)
   * - ``controller_server``
     - Local path following — publishes ``/cmd_vel`` (Twist)
   * - ``bt_navigator``
     - Subscribes to ``/goal_pose`` and orchestrates planning + control
   * - ``cmd_vel_to_ackermann``
     - Converts ``/cmd_vel`` (Twist) → ``/drive`` (AckermannDriveStamped)
   * - ``lifecycle_manager``
     - Manages the lifecycle of all Nav2 nodes

What is AMCL?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**AMCL** (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) is a particle filter that answers the question: *"Where am I on this map?"*

It works by maintaining a cloud of **particles** — hundreds of guesses of where the robot might be on the map. Each particle represents a possible pose (x, y, heading). On every laser scan, AMCL compares what the LiDAR actually sees against what it *would* see from each particle's position on the saved map. Particles that match well survive; particles that don't are discarded and replaced. Over time, the cloud converges around the robot's true position.

AMCL publishes the ``map`` → ``odom`` TF transform, which is how the rest of Nav2 knows the robot's position on the map. Without AMCL, the ``map`` frame does not exist and navigation cannot work.

**Why do I need to set a 2D Pose Estimate?** AMCL needs a starting guess. When Nav2 first launches, the particles are not initialized — AMCL doesn't know where to start looking. Clicking **2D Pose Estimate** in RViz2 gives AMCL an approximate starting position, and it spreads the initial particle cloud around that point. As the robot moves, the cloud narrows and localization becomes accurate.

.. note::

   You can visualize the particle cloud in RViz2 by adding a **ParticleCloud** display (under ``nav2_rviz_plugins``) on the ``/particle_cloud`` topic. A spread-out cloud means AMCL is still converging; a tight cluster means it is confident.

.. note::

   **Command pipeline:** Nav2's controller publishes ``Twist`` on ``/cmd_vel``. The ``cmd_vel_to_ackermann`` node converts this to ``AckermannDriveStamped`` on ``/drive``. The ackermann mux forwards ``/drive`` to the VESC, which drives the wheels.

   ``controller_server`` → ``/cmd_vel`` (Twist) → ``cmd_vel_to_ackermann`` → ``/drive`` (AckermannDriveStamped) → ``ackermann_mux`` (priority 10) → VESC

.. note::

   The default global planner plugin used by ``planner_server`` is
   ``nav2_navfn_planner``. It implements the classic **A\*** search algorithm
   (often referred to as *NavFn* in ROS literature) on the occupancy grid
   (a.k.a. costmap) to compute a low‑cost path from the current pose to the
   goal pose. A\* is optimal and complete when the heuristic is admissible, and
   it expands nodes in order of increasing ``f = g + h``. NavFn is simply the
   A\* implementation tuned for navigation maps; you can swap in alternate
   planners (e.g. SMAC) by changing the plugin in your Nav2 parameters.

   For the purposes of the tutorial you can treat the planner as a
   "black box" that returns a sequence of waypoints—the important part is that
   the controller server follows whatever path it provides.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **A saved map** — completed the SLAM tutorial with ``lab_map.pgm`` and ``lab_map.yaml`` in ``~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/f1tenth_stack/maps/``
- **Nav2 installed** — completed the :ref:`doc_setup_nav2` setup
- **Workspace rebuilt after saving the map** — Nav2 reads map files from the install directory, not the source directory. If you haven't rebuilt since saving your map, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd ~/f1tenth_ws
     colcon build --packages-select f1tenth_stack
     source install/setup.bash

Steps
-----

1️⃣ Start Bringup (Terminal 1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure the PlayStation controller is connected to the car, then open a terminal on the robot and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   bringup

This calls ``ros2 launch f1tenth_stack bringup_launch.py``, which starts the car's sensors and drivers.

.. note::

   If Nav2 later reports ``Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to odom``, the PlayStation controller is likely not connected. The VESC driver requires the joystick to fully initialize, and without it the ``odom`` frame is never published.

.. warning::

   **Hold R1 for autonomous mode.** By default the joystick continuously publishes zero-speed commands at high priority, blocking Nav2. Hold **R1** (button 5) on the PlayStation controller to enable autonomous mode — this lets Nav2's drive commands through. Releasing R1 returns to manual joystick control.

Leave this terminal running.

2️⃣ Launch Nav2 (Terminal 2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a **new** terminal and source the workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/f1tenth_ws
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   source install/setup.bash

Launch the full Nav2 stack (AMCL + map server + navigation). If you saved your map as ``lab_map``, you can use the default:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch f1tenth_stack nav2_launch.py

To load a different map, pass the ``map_name`` argument:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch f1tenth_stack nav2_launch.py map_name:=hallway_map

Change ``hallway_map`` to match the name you used when saving your map (without the file extension).

This launches the full Nav2 stack:

- **map_server** — loads your saved map and publishes the occupancy grid
- **AMCL** — localizes the car on the map using a particle filter (publishes the ``map`` → ``odom`` TF)
- **planner_server** — computes a global path from the car to the goal (A*)
- **controller_server** — follows the planned path by publishing velocity commands
- **behavior_server** — handles recovery behaviors (spin, backup, wait) when the car gets stuck
- **bt_navigator** — the behavior tree that orchestrates planning, control, and recovery into a complete navigation loop
- **cmd_vel_to_ackermann** — converts Nav2's ``/cmd_vel`` (Twist) to ``/drive`` (AckermannDriveStamped) for the F1TENTH

.. note::

   **Shutting down Nav2:** The Nav2 component container ignores repeated ``Ctrl+C`` (SIGINT). If Nav2 does not stop after pressing ``Ctrl+C``, use ``Ctrl+\`` (SIGQUIT) instead.

.. note::

   If map_server fails with ``Failed processing YAML file ... for reason: bad file``, the map file in the install directory is empty or corrupted. Check the source file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cat ~/f1tenth_ws/src/f1tenth_system/f1tenth_stack/maps/lab_map.yaml

   If the file has valid content, rebuild with ``colcon build --packages-select f1tenth_stack`` and relaunch. If the file is empty or missing, go back to the SLAM tutorial and save the map again, then rebuild.

Leave this terminal running.

3️⃣ Verify Nav2 is Running (Terminal 3)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a **third** terminal and check that the Nav2 lifecycle nodes are active:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 node list

You should see these Nav2 nodes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Node
     - Role
   * - ``/map_server``
     - Loads and publishes the occupancy grid map
   * - ``/amcl``
     - Localizes the car on the map (Monte Carlo localization)
   * - ``/planner_server``
     - Computes a global path from the car's pose to the goal (A*)
   * - ``/controller_server``
     - Follows the planned path by sending velocity commands to the car
   * - ``/bt_navigator``
     - Orchestrates planning and control via a behavior tree

Confirm the planner is ready by checking for the ``/plan`` topic:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 topic list | grep plan
