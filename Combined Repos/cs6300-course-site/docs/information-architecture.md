## Student Path

Students follow this course path from their first visit through the final lab:

```text
  -> Module A: Tutorial 1 -> Lab 1 -> Tutorial 2 -> Lab 2
  -> Module B: Tutorial 3 -> Lab 3 -> Tutorial 4 -> Lab 4
  -> Module C: Tutorial 5 -> Tutorial 6 -> Lab 5
  -> Module D: Tutorial 7 -> Tutorial 8 -> Lab 6a -> Lab 6b
```

Each tutorial is placed immediately before the lab that uses it. Any relevant RoboRacer's
lecture is linked within the matching tutorial section.

## Build/Repair Manual Boundary

The course site links to the Build/Repair Manual for any additional build or repair information.
This is linked to keep the site course focused. Ideally students should not need to utilize the Build/Repair
Manual.

The course site retains only the lab-specific commands and instructions students need
to complete course work on a pre-prepared robot.

## Rationale

This structure allows students to move from top down. It provides students with a predictable
and clear path throughout each module:
1. Learn from the tutorials and consult the related linked lectures as needed
2. Complete the related lab

This removes the confusion of having to scroll and jump between sections of the site to figure out
the correct path to follow. It keeps all related tutorials and labs in the same module section. The
removal of the "Setup" section and the transition to linked rather than embedded RoboRacer lectures
prevents the need to maintain duplicate information that is copied or forked across sites. The removal
of RoboRacer's modules, races, and final project makes students' actual deliverables clearer.
