Speed Adjustment Using PID Control for TTC
===========================================

Overview
--------

In **autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**, **Time-to-Collision (TTC)** is used to adjust vehicle speed dynamically. Instead of braking abruptly when TTC drops below a threshold, a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller** can **smoothly adjust speed** based on how TTC changes over time.

This approach provides **gradual deceleration and acceleration**, improving both safety and driving comfort.

1️⃣ Why Use PID Control for Speed Adjustment?
---------------------------------------------

A fixed TTC threshold (e.g., reducing speed when **TTC < 1.0s**) may cause:

- **Harsh speed reductions**, leading to inefficient driving.
- **Oscillations**, where speed fluctuates between slowing down and speeding up.
- **Overcorrections**, making the vehicle feel unstable.

A **PID controller** allows:

✅ **Gradual speed adjustments** based on TTC deviation.

✅ **Predictive control**, slowing down in advance if TTC is decreasing rapidly.

✅ **Smoother driving**, eliminating unnecessary fluctuations in speed.

2️⃣ PID Control Formula for Speed Adjustment
--------------------------------------------

The **error** is defined as the difference between desired and actual TTC:

.. math::

   e(t) = TTC_{\text{desired}} - TTC_{\text{actual}}

The **speed adjustment** output is calculated using:

.. math::

   V_{\text{adjustment}} = K_p e(t) + K_i \int e(t) dt + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}

Where:

- :math:`V_{\text{adjustment}}` = Speed adjustment (positive = accelerate, negative = decelerate).
- :math:`K_p` = Proportional gain (reacts to the TTC error).
- :math:`K_i` = Integral gain (corrects long-term speed errors).
- :math:`K_d` = Derivative gain (predicts sudden changes in TTC).
- :math:`e(t)` = TTC error.

3️⃣ How the Derivative Term Helps
---------------------------------

The **derivative term** predicts future risks by monitoring the **rate of change of TTC**.

**If TTC is dropping rapidly** → Reduce speed **aggressively** to prevent a collision.

**If TTC is stable** → Hold current speed **(avoid unnecessary slowing)**.

**If TTC is increasing** → Smoothly **increase speed** to improve efficiency.

Example:

- **Obstacle detected at a distance** → **Slowly reduce speed** (TTC decreases gradually).
- **Sudden obstacle appears** → **Rapid speed reduction** (TTC drops sharply).
- **Obstacle moves away** → **Smooth acceleration** to return to normal speed.

4️⃣ Example: PID-Based Speed Control
------------------------------------

Scenario: Adjusting Speed Based on TTC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Desired TTC** = **2.0s**
- **Actual TTC** = **1.0s**
- **Proportional Gain** = :math:`K_p` = 0.5
- **Integral Gain** = :math:`K_i` = 0.1
- **Derivative Gain** = :math:`K_d` = 0.4
- **TTC is dropping at** 0.3s per second

**Step 1: Compute the Error**

.. math::

   e(t) = 2.0 - 1.0 = 1.0

**Step 2: Compute Speed Adjustment**

.. math::

   V_{\text{adjustment}} = (0.5 \times 1.0) + (0.1 \times \int 1.0 dt) + (0.4 \times 0.3)

If the accumulated **integral error** over time is **2.0**, then:

.. math::

   V_{\text{adjustment}} = (0.5 \times 1.0) + (0.1 \times 2.0) + (0.4 \times 0.3)

Thus, the vehicle will **reduce speed smoothly by 0.82 m/s**, instead of braking immediately.

5️⃣ Considerations & Tuning
---------------------------

🛠 **Tuning Kd Carefully**

- **Kd too high** → Reacts too aggressively to minor TTC changes (unstable speed control).
- **Kd too low** → Delayed reaction to sudden changes (slower response).

🚗 **Tuning Strategy**

1. Start with **P-control only** to see basic responsiveness.
2. Add **I-control** to **correct steady-state speed errors**.
3. Introduce **D-control** to **anticipate sudden obstacles and prevent overcorrections**.

6️⃣ Summary
-----------

✅ **PID-based TTC speed control prevents abrupt slowdowns**.

✅ **The derivative term predicts risk before it happens**.

✅ **Results in smoother, more efficient speed adjustments**.
