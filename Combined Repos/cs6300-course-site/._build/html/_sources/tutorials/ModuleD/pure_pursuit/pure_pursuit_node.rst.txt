Running Pure Pursuit
=====================

Where This Fits
----------------

Pure Pursuit is a **Path Follower** — it takes the recorded waypoints and the real-time localized pose from the particle filter, and steers the car along the path. In the future, other algorithms like RRT will also fill this role.

Once waypoints are recorded, the pure pursuit node can drive the car autonomously around the track using the particle filter for localization.

How It Works
------------

Pure Pursuit is a geometric path tracking algorithm. On each update:

1. The node reads the car's current pose from ``/pf/pose/odom``
2. It finds the **lookahead point** — a point on the path a fixed distance ahead of the car
3. It computes the steering angle to arc toward that lookahead point
4. It publishes drive commands on ``/drive``

The lookahead distance controls the trade-off between tracking accuracy and smoothness. A shorter lookahead follows the path more tightly; a longer lookahead produces smoother but wider turns.

.. note::

   The ``pure_pursuit`` package, launch file, config file, and ``pure_pursuit_node`` do not come pre-installed. You must build them yourself first --- see **Lab 6b - Pure Pursuit** in the Weber Assignments for step-by-step instructions on creating the launch file, config, and writing the node.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Pure Pursuit node built (see :ref:`doc_tutorials_building_pure_pursuit_node`)
- Waypoints recorded (see :ref:`doc_tutorials_waypoint_recording`)
- ``bringup`` running (Terminal 1)
- ``ros2 launch particle_filter localize_launch.py`` running (Terminal 2)
- ``waypoint_viz`` running to visualize the path and lookahead target (Terminal 3):

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd ~/f1tenth_ws
     source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
     source install/setup.bash
     ros2 run waypoint_viz waypoint_viz_node --ros-args \
       -p waypoint_file:=~/f1tenth_ws/src/pure_pursuit/maps/waypoints.csv

- RViz2 running with the particle filter config (Terminal 4):

  .. code-block:: bash

     rviz2 -d ~/f1tenth_ws/install/particle_filter/share/particle_filter/rviz/pf.rviz

- Initial pose set via **2D Pose Estimate**

Steps
-----

1️⃣ Launch Pure Pursuit (Terminal 5)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/f1tenth_ws
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ros2 launch pure_pursuit pure_pursuit_launch.py

The car will begin following the recorded waypoints and loop the track continuously.

2️⃣ Watch the Lookahead in RViz2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``pf.rviz`` layout already shows the waypoint path and lookahead displays. Once a **2D Pose Estimate** is set, a green sphere in RViz2 (``/waypoint_viz/lookahead``) shows exactly which waypoint pure pursuit is currently targeting — it moves along the orange path in real time as the car drives. This is the key debugging tool: if the lookahead dot behaves unexpectedly (jumps, stays still, or points backward), the problem is in the waypoint search logic, not the steering calculation.

Key Parameters
--------------

Tune pure pursuit performance by editing the config file:

.. code-block:: bash

   nano ~/f1tenth_ws/src/pure_pursuit/config/pure_pursuit.yaml

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 15 55

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``lookahead_distance``
     - ``1.5``
     - Distance ahead on the path to steer toward (meters) — increase for smoother driving at speed
   * - ``speed``
     - ``1.0``
     - Forward drive speed (m/s)
   * - ``waypoint_file``
     - ``waypoints.csv``
     - Path to the recorded waypoints CSV

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Problem
     - Solution
   * - Car immediately stops or spins
     - Initial pose not set — set 2D Pose Estimate in RViz2 and re-launch
   * - Car cuts corners aggressively
     - Decrease ``lookahead_distance``
   * - Car oscillates side to side
     - Increase ``lookahead_distance``; reduce speed
   * - Car drifts off path over time
     - Particle filter may have diverged — re-set initial pose in RViz2
   * - No waypoints file found
     - Re-run waypoint recording; confirm path in ``pure_pursuit.yaml``
